            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the website of the "Bodelschwingher Hof" restaurant in the west of Dortmund. Our kitchen offers you 
                juicy, Argentinian steaks from the lava stone grill, fresh fish, or numerous other home-style and 
                Mediterranean specialties. The culinary highlights of the year such as the asparagus, mushroom, or game 
                season are accompanied by seasonal menus. When the summer weather is nice, you have the choice to spend time 
                in the cozy beer garden. Otherwise, the bright and modern winter garden is available for private and business 
                events for up to 100 people. The four fully automatic nine-pins bowling alleys are available for those who 
                want to be active in a cheerful atmosphere. There are enough parking spaces in front of the restaurant. Our 
                rooms are wonderfully suitable for larger groups. Whether a wedding, birthday, company, or family celebration: 
                We are happy to support you in the individual planning and execution of your event at the Bodelschwingher Hof.

                Croatian restaurant in Dortmund. She was born in Croatia and that's where she fell in love with cooking and 
                the kitchen. She went to culinary school in Split, Croatia. Milenka has over 30 years of experience in the 
                kitchen. She worked in the kitchen of a four-star hotel for over 15 years where she got exceptional knowledge 
                on serving elevated food and got to experiment with different types of cuisine. While working at the hotel 
                kitchen, Milenka as the executive chef has participated with her team in a culinary competition by the 
                Croatian Culinary Federation and won first place for dessert and second place for the main course. Bringing
